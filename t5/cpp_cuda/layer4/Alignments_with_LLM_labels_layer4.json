This is crucial for data parallelization as it ensures data integrity across multiple threads.  It's frequently used in kernel functions to specify input parameters that should remain unchanged during execution, improving code readability and preventing unintended side effects.  The context shows its use in defining constant array sizes and values passed to kernels, essential for efficient GPU memory management and parallel processing."

The code suggests that `boxes_before_nms` contains initial bounding box coordinates, and `boxes_for_nms` stores the results after some transformation (possibly adding an offset).
