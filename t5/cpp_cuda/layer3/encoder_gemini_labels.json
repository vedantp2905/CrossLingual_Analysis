      "Description": "The token 'dh' represents a variable storing the height offset of a bounding box in an object detection model.  It's part of a C++ function that performs bounding box regression, a crucial step in many object detection algorithms. The code calculates the predicted bounding box coordinates by adjusting the anchor box coordinates using the offsets (dx, dy, dw, dh) obtained from the model's output.  The 'if' statements ensure that the height offset does not exceed a specified clamp value. This is a common technique to prevent the model from predicting excessively large bounding boxes."

      "Description": "The tokens `locData`, `canData`, `srcData`, and `dstData` represent array pointers used to pass data to functions.  `getCanBusData` is a function that takes an array pointer as input. These functions perform operations on the data within these arrays, suggesting numerical computation and data transformation. The context strongly indicates image processing or deep learning operations, given the calculations involving bounding boxes and activation functions (LReLU)."
