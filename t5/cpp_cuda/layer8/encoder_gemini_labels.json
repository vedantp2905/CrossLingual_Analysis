This is crucial for detecting errors early in development and ensuring the program's internal consistency. In the given code, it's used to assert relationships between dimensions (stride and sample) in image processing functions, ensuring that the calculations are performed correctly. The assertions help in identifying potential issues with input parameters or algorithm logic."
