'void' specifies the return type (no return value), '*' indicates a pointer (essential for accessing GPU memory), '(' and ')' define the function's parameter list.  These elements are fundamental for defining and launching parallel kernels on the GPU.  The context shows how these tokens are used to define kernels that perform vector addition, array initialization, and other parallel operations."

The square brackets '[' and ']' are used for array indexing, accessing elements within CUDA arrays. The asterisk '*' is used as the multiplication operator and also as a pointer dereference operator in CUDA C/C++. The float literal '4.0f' represents a floating-point constant.  These elements are crucial for performing calculations and accessing data within CUDA kernels, which are essential for parallel processing on GPUs."
