      "Description": "The '->' operator is used in C++ to access members of a structure or class through a pointer.  In the provided code snippets, it's implicitly used when accessing array elements using pointer arithmetic.  The code performs various array operations such as element-wise addition, scalar multiplication, and array copying.  The semantic tags reflect the core functionality of directly manipulating data within arrays via pointers."
