This kernel is designed to run on a GPU, performing parallel data transfer from one array (`old_arr`) to another (`new_arr`).  The `__global__` keyword indicates that this function is a CUDA kernel.  `threadIdx.x`, `blockIdx.x`, and `blockDim.x` are built-in CUDA variables that provide thread and block indices, enabling parallel processing across multiple threads and blocks. The function copies data from `old_arr` to `new_arr` element by element, with each thread handling one element. This is a fundamental example of data parallel processing in CUDA."
